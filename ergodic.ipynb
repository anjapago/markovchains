    "Ergodic chains consist of transient states. As the chain runs, the probability of being in any of the states becomes fixed, $\\Pi(\\infty)$. The objective of this notebook is to calculate this distribution of probabilities,called the steady state, equilibrium probabilities, by several means: exact calculation, the \"matrix multiplication\" scheme, and simulations.\n",

    "## Transition Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition matrix for the ergodic chain with three states is $M_{ergodic}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{ergodic} = \\begin{bmatrix} m_{11} & m_{12} & m_{13} \\\\ m_{21} & m_{22} & m_{23} \\\\ m_{31} & m_{32} & m_{33} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.3 & 0.2 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.4 & 0.1 & 0.5 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.6 & 0.1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix describes the probability of going to any state given the current state. For example, if in state $2$, the probability of going to state $3$ is $m_{23}=0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Occupation Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "The state occupation probability at time zero is denoted $\\Pi(0)$, and this is a vector of the probabilities of being in any particular state at time $0$. This vector could be $\\Pi(0)=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}^T$, corresponding to starting in state $1$. This vector could also be a probability vector of the chance of starting in any of the states, for example a uniform starting probability vector: $\\Pi(0)=\\begin{bmatrix} 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3 \\end{bmatrix}^T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the probability of transitioning to each state after one step of the chain has been made, this will be determined by the state it is currently in, defined by $\\Pi(0)$, and the transition probabilities from the current state. To calculate the state occupation probability vector at step 1, the equation is $\\Pi(1)= M_{ergodic}^T \\Pi(0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be seen easily extend to a recurisve equation that will enable calculating the state occupation probability vector at any time $n$ based on the probability vector from the previous time step $n-1$, the equation is: $\\Pi(n)= M_{ergodic}^T \\Pi(n-1)$. This can therefore be used to calculate the probability vector at any time, given the vector at time $0$ : $\\Pi(n)= (M_{ergodic}^T)^n \\Pi(0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of time steps approaches infinity, the equation becomes: $\\Pi(\\infty)= (M_{ergodic}^T) \\Pi(\\infty)$, where the probability state vector converges to the \"stationary state\". This Stationary state probability vector can be seen as the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue of $\\lambda=1$ of the transition matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therfore, two ways to calculate this stationary state vector are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* find the eigenvalues of the transition matrix, and the corresponding eigenvector\n",
    "* approximate the transition matrix at $(M_{ergodic}^T)^{\\infty}$ to compute the stationary state based on $\\Pi(0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "These two approaches will be calculated. Then the markov chain will be simulated and run for many iterations, and the final state counts will be used as a way to calculate the approximate stationary state distribution."

    "\n",
    "The exact probabilities of the stationary (equilibrium) state are given by the equation $\\Pi(\\infty) = M_{ergodic}^T\\Pi(\\infty)$. Therefore, the stationary state probability vector can be interpreted as the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of the transition matrix $M_{ergodic}^T$ with the eignevalue $\\lambda = 1$. The equation for eigenvectors is $Av=\\lambda v$ where $A$ is a matrix, $v$ is a vector (the eigenvector), and $\\lambda$ is a scalar caled the eigenvalue. Therefore, to find the stationary state probability vector, the eigenvectors must be found, and the vector associated with eigenvalue of $\\lambda=1$ will be the probabilities of each state being occupied as the chain continues to run towards infinity.\n",
